HOW A BROWSER WORKS
->Anything that can get resources on the web and display is called as a client browser or a web client browser.
->We need to tell a browser to go get something out on the web with an URL.
->URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator.
->Generic form of URL:scheme://domain:port/path?query_string#fragment_id
->Scheme:http,https,ftp,...
->Domain:Name of the server
->port(default:80)
->path to resourse with name and extension
->query id which is optional
->fragment id which is optional
->The current URL displays at the top of the browser.You can type a URL and have the browser go get the resource
->URL's also appear in HTML tags for resources used in page and hyperlinks.
->First thing a browser is going to do is issue a hypertext protocol command called get.
->This command will go across the network in search of the machine that is given in the domain name and that machine will receive that request.
->The machine will take the path part and check in the database whether the content askeed by the web browser is present or not
->If the resource is found it returns to the browser and the browser accepts the file and starts to process it.
->The browser parses the HTML file.
->Parsing means it goes and gets the file and breaks it up into pieces and figures out what to do with the pieces.
->HTML contains text content,links to other resources and structure of the web page.
->Using the URL's in the web page it goes and fetches the resouces like images,videos,etc..
->Those resources look for style sheets or css in the page for appearance.
->Finally the HTML page looks for javascript in the page for behavior.
->After assembling,the browser stores them into document and stores them into an internal data structure.
->The main scope is to render the document.
->It also publishes the document as Document Object Model.
->Javascripts run and use Document Object Model.
->In the end,it all comes together as a smooth,fast and interactive user experience.
